Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: In last three values of N or N=10000 to N=1000000

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 1000, since it took least amount of time to calculate.
